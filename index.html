    <p>Hello! My name is Alan Christopher Monkman. I have created this page to tell you a little bit about myself. I am
      a 26 year old man, who lives in the city of Lynnwood just North of Seattle, Washington. I am a huge nerd, video
      games and anime are a huge passion of mine. Although, I also love to hit the gym and go hiking and fishing when
      the Seattle weather allows it. I have worked mostly blue collar jobs my entire life, my journey at Code Fellows is
      the first time I have been back to school as an adult and it is a very enjoyable experience so far. My dream is to
      learn as much as I can about software development so that I can work on some of the video games I love playing so
      much. Thank you for taking the time to check out my site! </p>
